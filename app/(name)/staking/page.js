                              AMMO is the utility and governance token used throughout the Bitsniper ecosystem. In order to maintain a robust ecosystem, we want to encourage our community to think about the long-term vision and benefits of Project Bitsniper.<br/><br/> Locking tokens within staking programs supports that vision and creates a layer of trust between all members of the community.
<br/><br/>
More opportunities will become available in the future, to further increase your potential as AMMO owner â€“ giving you a chance to prove your trust, and to earn even more rewards.
